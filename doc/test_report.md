##Test scenario 1:
**Purpose:**<br/>
Demonstrate the behavior of the four algorithms.

**Assumption:**<br/>
max_mem_size = 100, mem_start_address = 0

**Test Case:**<br/>
 1. set up memory environment by following requests:

> alloc 1 8 -> alloc 2 15 -> alloc 3 5 -> alloc 4 10 -> alloc 5 11 -> free 2 -> free 4 -> alloc 6 20 -> alloc 7 18 -> free 6

 2. submit request: 

> alloc 8 8

**Test Result:**<br/>
* Step 1 results following memory blocks:

* Now there are four free blocks as follows, and last memory allocation occurs at 69.

    | block#  | start address | size  |
    | ------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | 1 | 8  | 15 |
    | 2 | 28 | 10 |
    | 3 | 49 | 20 |
    | 4 | 87 | 13 |

* Result of step 2:
    First-fit: choose block 1. (search from 0, the first block larger than 8)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test1_step2_1.png" />

    Next-fit: choose block 4. (search from 69, the first block larger than 8)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test1_step2_2.png" />
    
    Best-fit: choose block 2. (the smallest block larger than 8)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test1_step2_3.png" />
    
    Worst-fit: choose block 3. (the largest block larger than 8)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test1_step2_4.png" />
    
**Conclusion**<br/>
* Best-fit: Choose the smallest free block of sufficient size.
* Worst-fit: Choose the largest free block of sufficient size.
* First-fit: Search from the beginning, choose the first free block of sufficient size.
* Next-fit: Search from where the last allocation occurs, choose the first free block of sufficient size.

##Test scenario 2:
**Purpose:**<br/>
Compare the fragmentation resulted from best-fit and worst-fit.

**Assumption:**<br/>
max_mem_size = 100, mem_start_address = 0

**Test Case:**<br/>
 1. set up memory environment by following requests:

> alloc 1 14 -> alloc 2 6 -> alloc 3 16 -> free 2 -> alloc 4 12 -> alloc 5 20 -> free 4 -> alloc 6 14

 2. submit request: 

> alloc 7 3 -> alloc 8 8 -> alloc 9 5 -> alloc 10 6 -> alloc 11 5

**Test Result:**<br/>
* Step 1 results:
    Both best-fit and worst-fit produce following memory usage.
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test2_step1.png" />

* Now there are four free blocks as follows, and last memory allocation occurs at 69.

    | block#  | start address | size  |
    | ------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | 1 | 14 | 6  |
    | 2 | 36 | 12 |
    | 3 | 82 | 18 |

* Result of step 2:
    Fragments produced by best-fit: (3, 4, 2)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test2_step2_1.png" />

    Fragments produced by worst-fit: (6, 1, 2)
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test2_step2_2.png" />
    
**Conclusion**<br/>
* Best-fit: All remaining holes are too small to be useful.
* Worst-fit: Compared to best fit, increases the possibility that the remaining space can be used by another process.

##Test scenario 3:
**Purpose:**<br/>
Compare first-fit with next-fit.

**Assumption:**<br/>
max_mem_size = 100, mem_start_address = 0

**Test Case:**<br/>
 1. set up memory environment by following requests:

> alloc 1 12 -> alloc 2 4 -> alloc 3 8 -> alloc 4 15 -> alloc 5 24 -> free 4

 2. submit request: 

> alloc 6 10 -> alloc 7 11 -> free 1 -> alloc 8 6 -> alloc 9 4 -> free 2 -> alloc 10 3

**Test Result:**<br/>
* Step 1 results:
    Both first-fit and next-fit produce following memory usage.
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test3_step1.png" />

* Result of step 2:
    Memory holes produced by first-fit:
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test3_step2_1.png" />

    Memory holes produced by next-fit:
    <img src="https://raw.github.com/ceciliazhou/dynamic_partition_simulator/master/doc/resource/test3_step2_2.png" />
    
**Conclusion**<br/>
* First-fit: Tends to fragment the low memory area, leaving larger free block(s) in the end of the memory.
* Next-fit: Compared to first-fit, tends to chew up the end of the memory.
